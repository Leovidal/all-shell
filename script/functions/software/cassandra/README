OVERVIEW:

These scripts allow a user to easily get some monitoring around their Cassandra clusters using Monitis.

INSTALLATION:
-------------

Download the source from github:

git clone git://github.com/monitisexchange/Monitis-Cassandra.git
cd Monitis-Cassandra

Next, you need to open the file, “settings.py”, and insert your API key and secret.  
Then add your column families to the column families list, and you are ready to 
create your custom Monitis monitors by running the following command:

./setup_monitors

After the monitors are setup you can start to send data by running:

./send_data

Set that to run on cron or any other scheduling agent, and you have yourself a fully
functioning monitoring system for your Cassandra cluster!  Check back in to the Monitis
Web site to see all your fresh Cassandra metrics rolling in.
