## The MySQL monitor ##

The current project represents the Bash script implementation of Monitis custom monitor approach that evaluate the health state of MySQL server.  
It measures locally or remotelly few parameters of MySQL and sends evaluation of health status into Monitis via the Monitis open API.  
The main purpose of current project is to show the possible way of using Monitis Open API for monitoring DB behavior.  
Naturally, a different variations of the presented code can be made in accordance user needs.  

#### Dependencies

  - This project is based on Bash 4.x+  
  - require the Linux kernel 2.6.x or higher  
  - require to have installed the __curl__ library that provides all HTTP connections  
  - uses Linux calculator (named '__bc__') to provide floating points calculations

          stop.sh               Stops daemon process-monitor

#### Measuring parameters

The current MySQL monitor measures the following parameters  

   - receive - The number of Kbytes received from all clients per second
   - send - The number of Kbytes sent to all clients per second
   - insert - Count of INSERT executed commands per second
   - select - Count of SELECT executed statements per second 
   - update - Count of UPDATE executed commands per second
   - delete - Count of DELETE executed commands per second
   - queries - The number of statements executed by the server per second
   - slow\_queries - The number of queries that have taken more than __long\_query\_time__ seconds in the monitoring period.
   - thread\_connected - The number of threads that are currently opened for connections which represent the number of connection attempts to the MySQL server.
   - thread\_running - The number of threads that are not sleeping and just represents the amount of queries which are being currently in processing.
   - connections\_usage - The percentage of used connections with respect to the maximum allowed connections count.
   - status - The evaluation of MySQL healt
      - DEAD - impossible to connect to MySQL server (could be down)
      - IDLE - MySQL server is in idle state
      - SLOW_QUERY - slow queries detected
      - OK - No any errors are detected
 
Please NOTE that current monitor have a possiblity to print out the top 5 slow queries as an additional result (for local MySQL only).  
This feature will be available only when MySQL slow queries log will be switchen on.  
Moreover, the slow queries log can be turned on/off any time by necessity to detect and optimize the MySQL performance.

  For MySQL 5.1.6 and above you can enable the slow query logging in MySQL by enter the following command(s)

  - Switching on the MySQL slow queries tracker  

        set global slow_query_log = 'ON';  
 
  - Set the path to the slow query log (optional)  

        set global slow_query_log_file ='/var/log/mysql/slow-query.log'; 

  - Set the amount of time a query needs to run before being logged (optional; default is 10 seconds)  

        set global long_query_time = 20; 
     
  For MySQL below 5.1.6 to do the following

  - Edit the /etc/my.cnf file with your favorite text editor
  - Add the following line under the "\[mysqld\]" section. 
     - The path to the log file can be whatever you want, e.g.  
        
        log-slow-queries=/var/log/mysql/slow-query.log

     - Set the amount of time a query needs to run before being logged (default is 10 seconds)  

        long_query_time=20     

  - Restart the MySQL server e.g. by command  

        service mysqld restart

In addition please take in account that MySQL monitor should be run under user that have credentials which allow to access (read/write) to MySQL _slow.log_ file.  
Alternatively, you can change the MySQL _slow.log_ file permissions so this allow monitor-running user to have (read/write) access.  
Normally, this file is located by default in the /var/lib/mysql folder.  

#### Customizing and Usage 

To use existing scripts you need to do some changes that will correspond your account and data  

  - in monitis_constant.sh  
     - replace _ApiKey_ and _SecretKey_ by your keys values (can be obtained from your Monitis account)
  - in monitor_constant.sh   
     - replace HOST, USER, PASSWORD by your monitored MySQL parameters  
     - replace MONITOR_NAME, MONITOR_TAG and MONITOR_TYPE by your desired names (optional)  

That's all.  

Now you can run your custom MySQL monitor by using e.g. the following command.  

        monitor_start.sh 1> /dev/null &

Or you can run your custom process-monitor by using embedded script.  

        start.sh

It will run it as a daemon process and prints only error messages.

The stop of process-monitor can be done by the following command

        stop.sh

#### Testing 

To check the correctness of monitor workability, some tests was done on remote MySQL 5.1.x server that was under real load.

The double-clicking on problematic measure (line with status SLOW_QUERY) switches desktop to show additional result

Please remember that the additional result will be shown top 5 slow queries for locally located MySQL server only.

Also the graphical view can be shown on desktop
